> You'll never make that. Your definition of good will change as you get better, 
> it will always be something you're not capable of. Whereas you know you can 
> make something that sucks, you live in terror of it. So do that! You also are 
> a very critical person, you're critical of your own work, other people's work, 
> so make something that sucks, then criticise itâ€¦ and fix it. That is a much 
> better way of getting something done than this idea that you're going to use 
> your brain which is so special, you're going to make all the right choices 
> because you're such a great, great person." - Dan Harmon
