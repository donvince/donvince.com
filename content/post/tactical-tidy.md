The shared drive has just filled up, people can't save their work, you've 
tried moving files around but people have them open. What to do?

There are more ways of dealing with this problem than there are clouds in the 
sky! One such possible approach is to go looking for the big vat of files which
are no longer used and taking up most the space. Randomly hunting around is one
way to achieve this, though an easier way is to use a funky tool, I present to
you the catchily named [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/)!

Once you've installed it, you point it at a drive or folder and it chews it's 
way through totalling up all the files and presents you with an ordered list, 
largest first of all the files and folders. The visualisation at the bottom
has larger boxes for bigger files, this is dead handy for finding the offending
stash of no longer needed files.
