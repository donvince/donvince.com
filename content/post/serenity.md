[Three Steps to Overcoming Worry](https://youtu.be/-V1WIJY8GFM) by Douglas Bloch

 * Notice what's happening: I'm worrying
 * I'm in the present right now, worry is in the future, it can't hurt me
 * Bring yourself back to the present, a distraction perhaps, listen to some music



> God grant me the serenity
> to accept the things I cannot change;
> courage to change the things I can;
> and wisdom to know the difference.
