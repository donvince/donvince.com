I used to play piano as a kid. It was difficult, challenging, fun, and 
interesting. At some point I must have stopped. That's a shame really, I 
would probably be very good now if I had continued.

Coulda/Woulda/Shoulda = all mostly useless:

 * time travel
 * reflecting on the past to plan differently for the future

So, having a musical keyboard around, I still found it difficult to break the 
ice and start playing again. Occasionally I'd do a session and not repeat for 
a long time.

It turns out that getting started again involved radically reducing scope of 
expectations. Five minutes a day. It's fine to not achieve much. Five minutes
isn't a difficult amount of time to find even during the busiest of times. It's 
not that much longer than how long the kettle takes to boil, next time you put 
the kettle on, just spend 5 minutes.

I started doing this after encountering the idea that 5 minutes a day has 
better results than 3 hours a week, unfortunately I lost the source of that 
thought and I don't know how scientifically it was arrived at, but it certainly
is more effective than 0 minutes!
