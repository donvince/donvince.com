Here's a delicious quote uncle Steven shared with me:

> "Any fool can criticize, complain, and condemn â€” and most fools do. But it 
> takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving."
>
> [Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/20907)

These are all perfectly natural reactions to something that you wish to
improve, however they aren't great strategies for actually improving whatever 
it is.

When someone criticizes something you made, what's the honest natural reaction?
Really honest? It's to become defensive, right? However _correct_ you are, why 
would anyone else react differently?

So if you want someone to become resentful and defensive, go ahead and 
criticize! Otherwise be mindful of this reaction inside yourself and consider 
choosing a more productive course of action.
