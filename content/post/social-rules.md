I often listen to the terrific podcast [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/)
in the episode "[The Recurse Center with Nick Bergson-Shilcock](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/09/07/the-recurse-center-with-nick-bergstrom-shilcock/)"
amongst other things, a delicious set of social rules, used at the Recurse 
Center (sic ðŸ˜‰), are discussed.

They are:

  * No feigning surprise
  * No well-actually's
  * No back-seat driving
  * No subtle -isms

Full explanation is available in their [manual](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules).

I'm fond of these rules. The set-piece for snagging is splendid: apologise, 
reflect, move on. Very much keeping the focus on the task at hand.
